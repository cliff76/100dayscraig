## 100 Days Of Craig

This is my #100DaysOfCode project. I'm not sure where it will end up or what I'll do but let's see what happens.

I currently have an Express server with 2 React client apps. Only the Todo app is working. 
With a little more effort I plan to figure out how to use ES6 imports from the proper path with webpack.

To see this example simply run
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then browse the todo.html from the main context.
I'm using yarn locally to manage dependencies and gulp as my build system.
